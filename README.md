# Project Title: 
REST Countries API with color Light Mode and Dark Mode Switcher Theme


# Date Completed: 
November 30, 2025

# Project Description: 
This application is a search based application challenge sponsored by Frontend Mentor. The challenge required integrating with the REST Countries API to pull country data and display it. The country data included information such as population, region, and capital. The challenged required that users have the ability to search for countries, filter countries by regions and navigate to border countries from individual country pages. 


# Links, Usage, and Instructions:
Copy this link https://shymeetriaj.github.io/html_css_javascript_projectone/ and paste it into your browser.
1. You can scroll the homepage and explore any country by clicking on the country's flag or information.
2. If you would like to search for a country by region. Use the filter at the top right of the home page to choose a region. You can also use the search feature to search for a country in a specific region. 
3. Clicking on a country takes you to a new page that displays more information about that country which includes the borders of that specific country. You have the ability to click on any border country and seamlessly navigate to that detailed page for that country.
4. At the top right of any page, you have the ability to toggle between light mode and dark mode for your veiwing pleasure.

# My process:
To begin this project, I first used pen and paper to frame out out all divs and components like buttons and inputs. This helped me configure my html layout and gave me some persepctive about what I would need to implement using HTML versus Javascript. After implementing the HTML structure, I organized my steps of Javascript implementation. I added a little styling just to give the header section some life. The first thing I did was create the dark mode toggle because I was excited about the feature itself. Then, I called all the components that I would need from the HTML file using getElementById. It was important to fetch the information from the API so that was the first function I created along with creating a function that rendered the country information to display inside of its own container. I set up conditionals for the information fetched. During the entire process I used try/cratch with the async functions to manage my asynchronous operations as I fetched from the API. I implemented inner html when creating my buttons and the information displayed on a country's detail page in Javascript. I also implemented several event listeners for dynamic and interactive features. Once I created my functions it took some to time configure the placement of them to make them work cohesively. I added css styling along the way but did most of it at the end. 


# My reflection:

The process of this challenge seemed a little daunting at firs, but I found my bearings as I took the time to break the tasks down into manageable parts. It was a great idea to use pen and paper to draw things out. It helped me figure out where to put containers, icons, and text. I took time to write out what functions I thought I would need and where to call them. I also wrote out everything that I knew would have to be created dynamically using Javascript. This structure helped with my flow because it made it easier to research the parts that I didn't understand or parts where I was stuck. My instructor, Bryan, always says using the console will help you. He was so right. Using the console helped me debug, along the way. I am no expert but I learned so much during this project and I feel so accomplished as a beginner. It was definitely hard and discouraging when I would implement a function or something else and then all of the API information would disappear but I learned so much. Concepts covered in class started making more sense to me but I still have trouble recalling the syntax and proper names. My favorite feature of this application is the dark and light toggle button. One of my least favorite parts of this project is when, I wrote to beautiful functions for the search box and the filter but through testing figured out that the functions needed to work cohesively. More work. I also learned that I should read the documentation so that I don't waste so much time.
